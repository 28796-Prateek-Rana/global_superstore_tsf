# Global Mart SuperStore

Global Mart is an online supergiant store that has worldwide operations. This store takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all 
the major product categories - consumer, coporate and home office.

As a sales manager for the store I had to forecast the sales of the product for the next 6 months, so that I have a proper estimate and can plan 
my inventory and business process accordingly.

## Objective:
To forecast the sales of the profits of the store for the next 6 months.

## Problem Statement:
The store has 7 geographical markets and 3 segments. I had to find the most consistently profitable market-segment and forecast the sales and demand 
for that market-segment. So I calculated the "Coefficient of Variance" (CoV) and selected the market-segment with the highest CoV. After acquiring the 
most consistently profitable market-segment, I had to forecast the profit for the next 6 months. I had to choose the right time series forecasting model
according to the possible trends and seasonality.
